== Transaction Participants

jPOS comes with some general purpose transaction participant implementations that
can be used as-is or used as a reference to write your own.

[TIP]
=====
The `<participant ...>` element supports an optional `enabled` attribute
that can be used disable participants at runtime. The `enabled` value can
either be 'yes/no/true/false` or a list of environment names (i.e.: `prod, staging`).
